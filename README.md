## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://react.dev/) - JS library
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### Continued development

I encountered a problem with the svg files, where the visibility tags with TailwindCSS were not working properly, thus not making possible to create a fully responsive interface for mobile devices.
